Signature-In-A-Block
=====================

- Your signature, in its cryptographic form (private-public key pair) as well 
as the actual one in written form, stored safely on the blockchain for 
very easy verification.

- Fully decentralized stack: **Ethereum** + **TensorflowJS** + **IPFS**,
Nothing is executed in a server, not even the ML training thanks to TensorflowJS, which runs on the browser

## Run Locally

You can run the dapp locally with truffle, ganache and lite-server

## Deploy to IPFS

## Disclaimer
This is an experimental project for educational purposes only. It is not audited and must not be used in production, on the Ethereum main network!
